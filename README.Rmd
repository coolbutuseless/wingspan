The R `{wingspan}` package makes available information about
the birds and bonus cards in the boardgame [wingspan](https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/)

Wingspan (the boardgame) was designed by Elizabeth Hargrave, with art by 
Natalia Rojas, Ana Maria Martinez Jaramillo, and Beth Sobel

The boardgame is a competitive, medium-weight, card-driven, engine-building board 
game, and is absolutely delightful!


This package just provides stats and data on the cards in the box - it won't 
really help you to play the game, and doesn't include any of the amazing artwork; 
it's just the facts about all birds and bonus cards as collected by 
[TawnyFrogmouth](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/TawnyFrogmouth) at 
[BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan)
  ([original data](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193164/wingspan-bird-card-bonus-card-spreadsheet)).


<div style="clear:both;" />

## What's in the box

* `birds` a data.frame of information about each of the cards in the base
  game and the expansions (europe and oceania)
* `bonus_cards` information about the cards used to give you a bonus at the 
  end of the game (based upon the numbers of birds of different types you 
  accumulate during the game)

## Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/wingspan) with:

``` r
# install.package('remotes')
remotes::install_github('coolbutuseless/wingspan')
```

### Example Bird Data

<img src="man/figures/barn-swallow.jpg" />

Some of the stats for the 2 birds at the bottom of this image are shown below.

```{r example}
library(dplyr)
library(wingspan)

wingspan::birds %>% 
  filter(common_name %in% c('Barn Swallow', 'Peregrine Falcon')) %>%
  select(common_name, scientific_name, points = victory_points, predator, 
         egg_capacity, nest_type, total_food_cost) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```


### Example Summary Plot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(birds, aes(as.factor(total_food_cost), victory_points)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(
    x = "Total food cost to play bird card",
    y = "Bird value (Victory points at end of game)",
    title = "Birds with higher total food cost score more victory points"
  ) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:10)

```
